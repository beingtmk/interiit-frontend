               Rahul Subramanian is an ex-corporate brand manager from Mumbai. Considering his weak business acumen and insatiable urge to make no sense, he started doing stand-up comedy in 2014. Mind you this is the only New Year Resolution he has successfully lived up to. In his comparatively short time in comedy, he has already won national open mics at the Pajama Fest, Canvas Open Mics and East India Comedy Virgin Pants. Surprisingly he managed all this without bribing the judges.

He will be opened by Manoj Prabhakar, who is a Chennai based stand-up comic. He is one of the top comics in this city. He has so far performed in major cities like Chennai, Coimbatore, Pondicherry, Bangalore, Kochi, Trivandrum, Hyderabad, Kolkata etc. His humorous take on his middle-class upbringing, his work life, his education and everything else that frustrates him have been well received so far. Catch them live on 20th December and forget all your worries with an evening full of laughter.
