            <h2>Mission</h2>

            <p>
                Sports has always been a part of our DNA. 
                The spirit and exhilaration that competition brings, 
                is something that cannot and should not be kept from anyone. 
                India also has a lot of sporting potential that goes unnoticed and unidentified, 
                often due to socio-economic realities like poverty, which needs redressal.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Social campaign will see many events like Inter NGO Sports meet, 
                Team outings, Tech for sports, and Impact league in collaboration with Imapactrun app etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                With these twin objectives in mind, Inter IIT Sports Meet 2017 presents Kridayog.
